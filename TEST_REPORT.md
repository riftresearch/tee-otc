# Test Suite Results

## Summary
The RFQ and MM servers have been successfully tested with comprehensive test suites covering functionality, performance, and edge cases.

## Test Results

### ✅ Passing Tests
1. **Basic Functionality**
   - ETH to BTC native token swaps ✓
   - BTC to ETH native token swaps ✓
   - Multiple market makers responding correctly ✓
   - Best quote selection working ✓

2. **Production Features**
   - Production metrics logging ✓
   - Non-blocking operations ✓
   - Memory leak prevention ✓
   - WebSocket communication ✓

3. **Performance**
   - Quote generation within acceptable latency (~500ms including external API calls)
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Stable memory usage under load

### ❌ Expected Failures
1. **Token Address Support**
   - Non-native tokens return "Unsupported token pair" (as designed)
   - Only ETH<->BTC native token pairs currently supported

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Zero amounts return no quotes (expected behavior)
   - Very small amounts may not generate quotes
   - Overflow amounts properly rejected

## Known Issues
1. **Test Timeouts**: Some comprehensive tests take longer due to:
   - Quote expiry tests (wait 35 seconds for expiry)
   - External API calls to fetch prices
   - Multiple concurrent operations

2. **Token Support**: Currently limited to native ETH<->BTC pairs

## Recommendations
1. Tests are functioning correctly
2. The 204 (No Content) responses are expected for unsupported token pairs
3. Production safeguards are working as designed
4. System is ready for native ETH<->BTC swaps
